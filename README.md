Nutrition Appointment Search

Nutrition Appointment Search is an innovative iOS prototype that connects patients with top nutrition professionals.
It displays a list of experts with profiles featuring ratings, languages, and areas of expertise, complemented by intuitive filtering options.
Selecting a professional opens a detailed profile view that includes an expandable "About Me" section.
Built with SwiftUI using MVVM, Async/Await, SOLID principles, and TDD, the app also supports offline usage through caching.
